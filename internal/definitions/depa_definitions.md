title: Glossary and Definitions
description: Glossary of all specialized definitions, names and phrases used in DEPA. If you dont understand a wording you will find answers here.
---

This section outlines the **definitions of all participants** within the data ecosystem, as defined by the **DEPA (Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture) Framework**.

The definitions provided herein are **general in nature**. The interpretation of legally-defined terms—such as *person*, *child*, *person with disability*, *lawful guardian*, *delegatee*, *nominee* etc.—is governed by the applicable **data protection laws in each jurisdiction**. 

> **Note:** Where such laws provide a specific definition, that definition shall prevail.

This framework is further supported by:
- **Processes and guidelines** from a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO)
- **Technical specifications** from a Technical Standards Organization (TSO)

---

### Additional Notes:

- Each definition is accompanied by a **simple example for clarity**.
- Many examples feature **Rajni**, a fictional individual from rural India, to illustrate **real-world relevance and accessibility**.
- All names used in the examples are **fictional and solely for illustrative purposes**.
