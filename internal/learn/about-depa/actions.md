# Actions

- **Network Onboarding** - All the participants of a transaction i:e Consent Manager, Data Provider and Data Consumer must get themselves on-boarded to a registry. It's post onboarding only that these entities will be able to discover, do resolution of each other and participate in a data transaction. A registry will facilitate the on-boarding workflow.

- **Resolution** - Entities will have to resolve each other for having access to the metadata of the entity and the service endpoints where the connection can be established. A registry will expose resolution functionality for the entities on its network.

- **Linking Accounts** - A user needs to link his DPs with the consent manager. This linking can be initiated via the DP itself or the CM, in the latter case there will be a need to discover the DPs on the CMs interface before the linking can be initiated. The linking will enable exchange of tokens between the DP and the CM and build a trust relation between the two entities. The linking process will also enable the CM to know about the accounts which user has associated with it, this will be required at the time of consent collection.

- **Consent collection and sharing** - The consent is collected by the CM and shared with DP and DC. Sharing of consent will enable the sharing of data as a next step. A precursor to giving consent is the linking of accounts with DP so that users can select the accounts and DPs from where the data needs to be shared with the DC. A User can select multiple DPs and accounts for a single consent.

- **Data fetching** - Post the consent is shared with the DC, DC initiates the fetching of data from DP. The data transfer will be P2P between DP and DC but facilitated by the CM.

- **DP Discovery** - A DP discovery will only be needed in case the user initiates the linking from the CMs system. Since all the entities are on boarded onto a registry, registry will enable the discovery of DP via APIs. CM will use these APIs to assist users in discovering DPs.

The responsibility of a registry is very minimal. A registry enables the transacting entities (DPs, CMs and DCs) to discover each other on the network (and their respective communication addresses) and helps establish trusted one-to-one connections between them. No traffic passes through a registry. Even consent request creation, the sharing of consent artifacts and notifications across entities happens in a peer-to-peer manner.
