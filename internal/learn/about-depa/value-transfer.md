# Principle of reciprocity

An entity that plays the role of PDC during one transaction may play the role of PDP in another. This enables the PDC to serve as a personal data provider to others seeking that data. Indeed, for an ecosystem to develop around our architecture, it is valuable for the entities to follow this Principle of Reciprocity.

**Every entity that consumes consented personal data must serve as a provider of that data to other, potential consumers.**
