# Confidential Clean Rooms

In the DEPA training framework, datasets are brought together and processed in secure environments known as _confidential clean rooms_. Confidential clean rooms intend to meet a set of privacy and security goals through technical measures. This includes:

- Prevent inappropriate access to raw data or other intermediate data through technical enforcement.
- Allow TDPs to retain control over the data they've shared without trusting any third party.
- Allow TDCs to retain control over the models they are training without trusting any third party.
- Enforce constraints on data usage defined in contracts. This includes noise addition during analytics and training in line with the long-term goal of differential privacy.
- Support flexible, scalable, and extensible training so that TDCs can choose when and what kinds of models they wish to train.
- Provide open and transparent implementations for all infrastructure components.

## Confidential Computing

Confidential clean rooms are based on novel security features for [confidential computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing). Confidential computing, available in most modern CPUs and GPUs (Intel SGX and TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA and NVIDIA Confidential GPUs), utilizes hardware-based _Trusted Execution Environments_ (TEEs) to isolate code and data of a given task from the rest of the platform, including privileged entities such as server administrators and hackers who may have compromised the platform. Therefore, the task can be trusted with sensitive data, as hardware memory encryption and access control ensure it will be accessible only to the TEE code.

A core feature of confidential computing is remote attestation: the TEE code can request the hardware to attest a given message (such as a public key), together with the digests of its binary image and configuration, measured when the TEE was created. The attestation is signed with a key unique to the CPU and is backed by a public-key certificate for the platform (endorsed by the hardware vendor). By verifying this signature, a user can thus authenticate the TEEâ€™s code and hardware platform before trusting it with sensitive data.

## Confidential Clean Rooms using Confidential Containers

Trusted Execution Environments or TEEs can be used to host a variety of workloads, ranging from individual processes to full virtual machines. The DEPA training framework relies on a special class of TEEs that can host _containerized_ workloads with the ability to generate a full workload attestation; we refer to these TEEs as _confidential containers_.

Confidential containers are already supported by most cloud platforms, including [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/), [Confidential Spaces on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/announcing-confidential-space) and [Confidential Azure Container Instances on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-confidential-overview).

A confidential clean room utilizes confidential containers to host a set of containers which together load encrypted datasets, execute an ML pipeline, and generate an encrypted model. The clean rooms ensures the following properties:

- Raw datasets are decrypted only within the confidential clean room.
- Raw datasets and all intermediate state generated in the clean room remains protected from all entities including the TDC, clean room provider, and the cloud environment.
- CCRs execute an ML pipeline only in accordance with one or more signed contracts.
- Any outcomes generated by the confidential clean room are released only after meeting constraints specified in the contracts.
- The entire clean room environment is fully attestable i.e., capable of generating hardware-based cryptographic attestations that capture the entire training pipeline.
- After training completes, all sensitive state from the clean room is scrubbed before the clean room is terminates and any assigned resources (such as compute, memory and devices) are released.

## Training Workflow

In the DEPA training framework, TDCs employ confidential clean rooms to train their models on datasets based on contracts signed with TDPs and registered with the contract service. The overall training workflow is as follows.

- TDC provides the CCR provider with a description of the model they wish to train, including signed contracts permitting the TDC to access the datasets required for training.

- In preparation for the training job, the CCR provider may download and cache encrypted datasets into their own local storage. This is purely for efficiency as the CCR provider will not be able to decrypt the datasets.

- CCR provider creates a confidential clean room using SRO certified code.

- During launch, the CCR verifies authenticity and validity of contracts. The CCR terminates if any of the provided contracts are not correctly signed (e.g., if the identities of the signers have expired) or no longer valid (e.g., have been revoked).

- CCR use a key release protocol to obtain data and model encryption keys from key management services hosted by TDPs. As part of the key release protocol, CCR SHOULD provide attestation evidence to the key management service. Evidence MAY include raw attestation reports along with certificates issued by the hardware manufacturer OR attestation tokens issued by an attestation service.

- Key management services independently verify evidence against key release policies configured by the TDP, perform additional book keeping (such as track privacy budgets), and release data encryption keys securely to the CCR.

- CCR uses encryption keys to decrypt the datasets and model. The CCR ensures that decrypted models and datasets are appropriately protected from the hosting platform, including the CCR provider.

- The datasets may be pre-processed within the CCR e.g., aggregate or join as long as the operations are permitted by contracts.

- The CCR loads the model and trains the model on the pre-processed dataset as per the model configuration. The CCR may partition the dataset into train and test dataset as per TDC requirements. Training must meet all constraints specified in the respective contracts. For example, CCR must use certified training algorithm to inject appropriate noise in the model weights so as to stay within the privacy budget allocated for each dataset.

- During the training process, the CCR may notify the contract service.

- After training is complete, the CCR makes the trained model available to the TDC along with metrics such as loss and accuracy on the validation dataset.
