# DEPA Training Framework
The Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture is enabling millions of citizens to share their personal information with fine-grained, purpose-limited consent. This GitHub repository contains extensions to DEPA for enabling secure sharing of bulk de-identified data for purposes such as analytics and training while preserving privacy of data principals. These extensions will allow organizations to train AI models and offer personalized services while meeting compliance requirements enshrined in modern privacy laws.
