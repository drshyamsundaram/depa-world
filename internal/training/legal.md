# Legal FAQ

## Is explicit and fine-grained consent from data principals required for sharing data under the DEPA training framework?

As per modern privacy laws, explicit and fine-grained consent obtained from data principals is a valid legal basis for data processing. However, privacy laws also support other legal basis for processing e.g., when data processing does not violate the right to privacy of data principals. The DEPA training framework provides technical guardrails based on privacy-preserving technologies to minimize the risk of privacy violations. Therefore, explicit and fine-grained consent might not be actively sought from data principals. However, depending on the scenario, SROs may stipulate that TDPs collect appropriate course-grained consent describing the broad purpose for which their data will be used before including a data principal's data in aggregated datasets. 

## Are signed contracts legally valid documents? 

Yes. Signed digital contracts as defined in the DEPA training framework are given evidentiary value within the Indian Evidence Act. 

## Are their any guardrails against societal harms caused by models trained using the DEPA training framework?

The DEPA training framework requires TDCs to include  any reported and anticipated risks from their proposed AI model in contracts.
