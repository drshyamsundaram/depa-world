# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation of DEPA training is available [here](https://github.com/iSPIRT/depa-training). The implementation includes

- A [contract service](https://github.com/kapilv/contract-ledger) to be deployed by a SRO where TDPs and TDCs can register their datasets, contracts and models.
- A [confidential clean room](https://github/com/iSPIRT/depa-training/main/src) implementation using Confidential Containers on Azure.

We actively welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Please do reach out to discuss this by opening an issue.
