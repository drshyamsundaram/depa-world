# Roadmap

## Support for multiple cloud platforms

The initial reference implementation is based on Azure (using the serverless Confidential Containers offering). In due course of time, we will release reference implementations for GCP and AWS. 

## Richer pipelines

The reference implementation supports a pipeline with basic aggregation operations and training. We will extend the implementation to support richer class of operations e.g., data transformations and augmentations. 

## Privacy budget management
